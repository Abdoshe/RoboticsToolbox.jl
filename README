Port of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox to Julia.

This is just a test.

These functions have been ported but do not yet allow setting options as in the
MATLAB versions and only operate on single matrices at this point:

rot2, rotx, roty, rotz
trot2, trotx, troty, trotz
se2, se3
r2t, t2r
rpy2r, rpy2t, rpy2jac, tr2rpy


Licence
-------
Tentatively licensed under the GPLv3.


Requirements
------------
Julia 0.5.0+.


Usage
-----
You will need to add the repo's src/ directory to the JULIA_LOAD_PATH
environment variable.  On Linux:

export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=$JULIA_LOAD_PATH:/path/to/RoboticsToolbox.jl/src


You can then make all ported functions available with:

using RoboticsToolbox.transform

See test/transform.jl for usage examples.


To run the tests (all passing currently) run the following from the top
directory:

julia src/test/runtests.jl

Ensure that julia is the julia executable.


Documentation
-------------
Coming soon.
